# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-13)

**Core value:** A harness that makes a cheap model produce work you'd trust from an expensive one — without the harness itself becoming the bottleneck.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Bootstrap, Packaging & Supply Chain

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Bootstrap, Packaging & Supply Chain)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-13 — Roadmap created; 107/107 v1 requirements mapped across 11 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Horizontal layers in dependency order — `callModel()` is a Phase 2 export that Phases 5 and 8 import; routing cannot be verified without the instrument that proves which model ran.
- [Roadmap]: `ignore-scripts=true` precedes the first `pi install` (Phase 1). A pinning policy applied afterwards is applied to code that already ran.
- [Roadmap]: The prose-tool-call detector lives in Diagnostics (Phase 2), not Quality Gates — it is the leading root-cause candidate and it interacts with evidence-gating to fabricate evidence.
- [Roadmap]: Safety (Phase 4) depends on Phase 1 only, not on routing. GitLab server-side protected branches ship before any hook is trusted.
- [Roadmap]: A skeletal `/quick` is pulled forward to Phase 6 as a walking skeleton, exercising route → guard → execute → evidence → commit before any ceremonial workflow is built on it.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **UNRESOLVED (R1)**: Whether DeepSeek-direct accepts `reasoning_effort: "low"`. Settled by one request in Phase 3 (PROV-07), gated behind Phase 2. Until then `/cheap` must not be defined in terms of a cheap thinking tier.
- **Root cause still open**: prose tool calls vs context pollution vs provider misconfiguration. Phase 2 measures, Phase 10 discriminates. Do not commit to a fix for an unmeasured cause.
- **No credentials on the dev machine**: 8 of 107 requirements are [RUNBOOK] and need the work laptop. `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (PROV-09, Phase 3) is the deliverable that carries them.
- **Moving platform**: Pi ships every 2–3 days; the composed extension ecosystem ships 13–16 releases/month. Every pin must be re-verified at Phase 7 planning time, not inherited from research.
