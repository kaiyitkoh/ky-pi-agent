# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-13)

**Core value:** A harness that makes a cheap model produce work you'd trust from an expensive one — without the harness itself becoming the bottleneck.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Bootstrap, Packaging & Supply Chain

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Bootstrap, Packaging & Supply Chain)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-13 — Roadmap created; 107/107 v1 requirements mapped across 11 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Horizontal layers in dependency order — `callModel()` is a Phase 2 export that Phases 5 and 8 import; routing cannot be verified without the instrument that proves which model ran.
- [Roadmap]: `ignore-scripts=true` precedes the first `pi install` (Phase 1). A pinning policy applied afterwards is applied to code that already ran.
- [Roadmap]: The prose-tool-call detector lives in Diagnostics (Phase 2), not Quality Gates — it is the leading root-cause candidate and it interacts with evidence-gating to fabricate evidence.
- [Roadmap]: Safety (Phase 4) depends on Phase 1 only, not on routing. GitLab server-side protected branches ship before any hook is trusted.
- [Roadmap]: A skeletal `/quick` is pulled forward to Phase 6 as a walking skeleton, exercising route → guard → execute → evidence → commit before any ceremonial workflow is built on it.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **UNRESOLVED (R1)**: Whether DeepSeek-direct accepts `reasoning_effort: "low"`. Settled by one request in Phase 3 (PROV-07), gated behind Phase 2. Until then `/cheap` must not be defined in terms of a cheap thinking tier.
- **Root cause still open**: prose tool calls vs context pollution vs provider misconfiguration. Phase 2 measures, Phase 10 discriminates. Do not commit to a fix for an unmeasured cause.
- **No credentials on the dev machine**: 8 of 107 requirements are [RUNBOOK] and need the work laptop. `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (PROV-09, Phase 3) is the deliverable that carries them.
- **Moving platform**: Pi ships every 2–3 days; the composed extension ecosystem ships 13–16 releases/month. Every pin must be re-verified at Phase 7 planning time, not inherited from research.

## Deferred Items

## Standing Operating Policy — Autonomous Run

Set by the user on 2026-08-13 before an unattended overnight run. **In force until the v1.0 milestone completes.**

1. **Delegate to subagents.** Planning, execution, and review run in spawned agents, not inline. The orchestrator context must stay lean across an 11-phase run — it will not survive otherwise.
2. **Code review after every phase**, in a spawned agent, checking end-to-end that no bugs or regressions were introduced. Not advisory: findings get fixed before advancing.
3. **Do not ask the user anything until the milestone is done.** Two standing pre-authorisations:
   - Verification `human_needed` caused by `[RUNBOOK]` items → build it, write the runbook entry, mark the live check **outstanding** (never "passed"), continue.
   - Verification `gaps_found` → this means something was genuinely *not built*, which is not the same as not-yet-verified-live and is **not** covered by the above. Close the gap; do not silently advance.
4. **Follow Pi's own documentation and bundled examples** over third-party blog posts or extension READMEs. Verify against published TypeScript (recoverable from `dist/**/*.js.map` `sourcesContent`) and cite `file:line`. Mark anything unverifiable as UNVERIFIED rather than asserting it.
5. **`workflow.skip_discuss` is `true`** — each phase uses its ROADMAP goal and success criteria as the spec. Grey-area implementation choices are at Claude's discretion, guided by the ROADMAP criteria and `.planning/research/`.
6. **Always pass `--research` to `plan-phase`.** Without it, `plan-phase` prompts "Research before planning Phase N?" whenever `RESEARCH.md` is missing — which is every phase. The flag forces research and skips the prompt. `nyquist_validation` requires `RESEARCH.md` anyway, so research must run regardless.
7. **UI gates are disabled deliberately** (`ui_phase`, `ui_safety_gate`, `ui_review` all `false`). GSD's frontend detector is a case-insensitive substring match on `UI|interface|frontend|component|layout|page|screen|view|form|dashboard|widget`, and **all 11 phases trip it** — Phase 1 matches because "package" contains "page". With the safety gate on, `plan-phase` exits outright on a phase with no `UI-SPEC.md`. Phase 11 is a *terminal* UI, not the web frontend the UI-SPEC contract is designed for, so the gate has nothing correct to contribute here. Do not re-enable.
8. **Do not ruminate.** The decisions are already made and written down. Agents implement PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md and the research documents — they do not re-derive or re-litigate them. If a choice is genuinely open, pick the option consistent with the recorded decisions, note it in one line, and move on.

Everything the user cares about is already captured in PROJECT.md (Key Decisions, Constraints), REQUIREMENTS.md (107 requirements with `[FAUX]`/`[RUNBOOK]` tags), and ROADMAP.md (per-phase success criteria and Carried-Forward Unknowns). Those are the contract — build to them.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-08-13
Stopped at: Roadmap approved and committed. Phase 1 CONTEXT.md written and committed (auto-generated, discuss skipped). Autonomous run started, then paused for a context clear before planning began.
Resume file: None

Next: `/gsd:autonomous` — Phase 1 has CONTEXT.md already, so it resumes at plan-phase.
